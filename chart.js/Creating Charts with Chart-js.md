Chart.js is a popular open-source JavaScript library for creating charts on a webpage.

Here are the basic steps for creating a chart using Chart.js:

### Download Chart.js

You can download Chart.js from the Chart.js website or use a content delivery network (CDN) to add it to your webpage. Here's an example using the CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@3.6.1"></script>
```

### Create a canvas element

You will need to create a canvas element in your HTML code to hold the chart. The canvas element should have an id so that you can reference it later.

```html
<canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
```

### Create a context object

Next, you will need to create a context object to draw the chart. You can do this by selecting the canvas element by its id and calling its `getContext()` method.

```javascript
const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
```

### Define the data

Now you will need to define the data that will be displayed in the chart. This data can be stored in an array or object.

```javascript
const data = {
  labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July'],
  datasets: [{
    label: 'Sales',
    data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3, 15],
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
    borderColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
    borderWidth: 1
  }]
};
```

In this example, we have a single dataset with the label 'Sales' and data for each month. The backgroundColor and borderColor properties set the color of the chart.

### Create the chart object

Next, you will need to create a chart object using the `Chart()` constructor. You can pass in the context object, the chart type (e.g. 'bar' or 'line'), and the data object.

```javascript
const myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
  type: 'bar',
  data: data
});
```

In this example, we're creating a bar chart. Chart.js also supports other types of charts, such as line charts, pie charts, and radar charts.

And that's it! You should now have a working chart on your webpage. Of course, there are many more options and configurations you can use to customize your chart, but these are the basic steps to get started with Chart.js.
