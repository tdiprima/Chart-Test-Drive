## Grid chart ðŸ“Š

**What is a grid chart called?**<br>
A lattice graph, mesh graph, or grid graph, is a graph whose drawing, embedded in some Euclidean space Rn, forms a regular tiling.

**What does a grid chart show?**<br>
The grid chart is similar to the scatter chart but plots dimension values on the axes and uses an expression to determine the plot symbol.
