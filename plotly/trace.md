## The "trace" variable

<span style="color:#0000dd;">I see the variable `trace` being used in numerous plotly examples.  Why "trace"?  Because we're tracing a line on the page?</span>

The term "trace" in Plotly terminology refers to a ***single data series*** or object that you want to plot.

Each trace specifies what type of visualization to use (e.g., scatter plot, bar chart, line chart, etc.) and provides the data necessary for that visualization.

The name "trace" does not directly relate to tracing a line on the page, but you could think of it as ***tracing out or plotting a particular set of data*** on the chart. For each trace, you define the type of plot you want and the data associated with it.

For example, in a line chart, a single trace would represent a single line. In a bar chart, a single trace could represent a series of bars. If you want to display multiple lines or bar series on the same chart, you would define multiple traces.

So, in the context of Plotly, a "trace" is essentially a set of instructions and data for drawing a specific part of the chart. This naming convention is used to help organize and manage the different components of a Plotly chart.
